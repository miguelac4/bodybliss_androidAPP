    <string name="d_banner_about">“Promoting well-being is not a luxury — it’s a necessity.”</string>
    <string name="text_about">BODYBLISS was born from my passion for Therapeutic Massages and the creation of unique handmade pieces, like aromatic candles and Jesmonite décor.&#10;&#10;The name combines &quot;BODY&quot; (body, self) with &quot;BLISS&quot; (ecstasy, happiness), reflecting the purpose of offering well-being, relaxation, and harmony.&#10;&#10;Each candle is crafted with care and tailored to the preferences of the person receiving it — more than just decoration, they are gifts with soul.&#10;&#10;Whether through a massage with natural oils or by lighting a custom-made BODYBLISS candle, the goal is always the same: to help you slow down and reconnect with your inner self.&#10;&#10;Allow yourself this experience.&#10;BODYBLISS YOURSELF ♥</string>
